# Overview


Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood. It is called a "spectrum" disorder because people with ASD can have a range of symptoms like social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. Autism can’t be remedied but if identified early, efficacious measures can be taken to reduce the adverse effects of it. 

About 1 in 54 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to estimates from CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. 

To solve this problem of social/verbal communication, and difficulty in learning. We will build an AR/VR application that will avail the child overcome his communication fears and avail him to learn in our VR environment as well.
Features of our VR world:-

* Child can roam around the VR world and interact with the characters who will respond both via text and audio which will help the child both to read and understand thereby diminishing his social awkwardness.

* Our VR world will have a calm environment to trigger joint attention that is help the child share his/her interests and regulate their behavior while the parent can access information to understand his/her child's progress. Our application has virtual reality scenarios of real life situations so as to help child overcome his/her fear for that situation when it comes to real life.
